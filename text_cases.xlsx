## Project Scope
### 1. Functional and Regression Testing
- Verify core functionalities like user registration, login, search, cart, checkout, and payment processing.
- Perform regression testing to ensure previously fixed defects do not reappear.

### 2. Test Case Design (Excel)
- Create detailed test cases in Excel covering positive and negative scenarios.
- Categorize test cases based on functionality (Login, Search, Checkout, etc.).

### 3. Defect Reporting (JIRA)
- Log defects with details such as severity, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results.
- Collaborate with the development team to resolve issues efficiently.

## Sample Defect Report Format (JIRA)
```
| Defect ID | Module        | Issue Summary                  | Severity | Status  |
